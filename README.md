# GARG Agentic Framework

**Goal-Augmented Reverse Generation (GARG)** is an **agentic reasoning framework** that starts from the **end goal** and works **backwards** to determine the necessary conditions, uncover hidden assumptions, and identify the root problems.  

Unlike traditional forward planning, GARG uses a **deductive-backward** approach:  
- Begin with the desired outcome.  
- Work backward to determine required actions, dependencies, and constraints.  
- Generate actionable and verifiable steps to reach the goal.

## 🚀 Key Concepts

- **Deductive-Backward Reasoning**  
  Start from the final objective and deduce the path to get there.

- **Goal-Augmentation**  
  Enhance goals with richer context, constraints, and success metrics.

- **Reverse Generation**  
  Identify the "must-happen" events before the goal can be achieved.

- **Assumption Surfacing**  
  Reveal hidden dependencies and risks early in the process.

## 📂 Example Use Cases

- **Incident Response** – Start from a resolved incident state and backtrack the required steps and automated actions.
- **Product Roadmapping** – Define the product vision, then reverse-map dependencies and deliverables.
- **AI Planning Agents** – Goal-first task decomposition for autonomous agents.
- **Root Cause Analysis** – Work from failure back to the origin.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Define the Goal**  
   Specify a clear, measurable objective.

2. **Work Backward**  
   Identify preconditions that must be met for the goal to be true.

3. **Uncover Dependencies**  
   Determine hidden requirements and bottlenecks.

4. **Generate Action Plan**  
   Reverse the chain to create a forward execution plan.
